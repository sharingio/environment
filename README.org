#+end_quote

A refinement and replacement for the container and Pair related components of [[https://github.com/humacs/humacs][humacs/humacs]] (a configuration for Emacs + Doom-Emacs).
This environment is used when deployed in [[https://github.com/sharingio/pair][Pair]] instances.
It contains many useful utilities, humacs for it's Emacs configuration, and some useful general configuration.

Additional components include:
- [[./cmd/environment-exporter/][environment-exporter]] ::
  a webserver to export a list of processes that are listening on ports
- [[./cmd/environment-exposer/][environment-exposer]] ::
  a reconciler for creating Kubernetes Service and Ingress resources to map back to environment, based off of environment-exporter's data
